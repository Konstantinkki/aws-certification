		SMTP interface
		Or AWS SDK
	Ability to receive email. Integrates with :
		S3
		SNS
		Lambda

	Integrated with IAM for allowing to send emails
=================================================================     ,
Amazon OpenSearch Service
	Amazon OpenSearch is successor to Amazon ElasticSearch
	In DynamoDB, queries only exist by primary key ot indexes...
	With OpenSearch you can search any field, even partially matches
	It's common to use OpenSearch  as a compliment to another database
	Two modes: managed cluster or serverless cluster
	Does not natively support SQL (can be enabled via a plugin)
	Ingestion from Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS IoT, and CloudWatch Logs
	Security through Cognito & IAM KMS encryption, TLS
	Comes with OpenSearch Dashboards(visualization)
======================================================================
Amazon Athena
	Serverless query service to analize data stored in Amazon S3
	Uses standard SQL Language to query the files (build on Presto)
	Supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet
	Pricing $5 per TB of data scanned
	Commonly used with Amazon Quicksight for reporting/dashboards

	Use cases: Business intelligence/ analytics / reporting, analize & query VPC Flow Logs, ELB Logs, CloudTrial trails, etc...
	Exam Tip: analize data in S3 using serverless SQL, = use Athena
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Athena - Performance Improvement
	Use columnar data for cost-saving (less scan)
		Apache Parquet or ORC is recommended
		Huge performance improvement
		Use Glue to convert your data to Parquet or ORC
	Compress data for smaller retrievals (bzip2, gzip, lz4, snappy, zlip, zstd)
	Partition databases in S3 for easy quering on virtual columns
		s3://myBucket/pathToTable
			/<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE>
			    /<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE>
				/<PARTITION_COLUMN_NAME>=<VALUE>
				   /etc
		Example: s3://athena-examples/flight/parquet/year=1991/month=1/day=1/
	Use largEr files(>128 MB) to minimize overhead
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Athena - Federated Query
	Allows you to run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non-relational  object and custom data sources (AWS or on-permises)
	Uses Data Source Connectors that run on AWS Lambda to run Federated Queries(e.g. CloudWatch Logs, DynamoDB, RDS, ...)
	Store the result back in Amazon S3
==============================================================================
Amazon Managed Streamingfor Apache Kafka (Amaon MSK)
	Alternative to Anazon Kinesis
	Fully managed Apache Kafka on AWS
		Allow you to create update delete clusters
		MSK creates and manages Kafka brokers nodes & zookeeper nodes fot you
		Deploy the MSK cluster in your VPC, multi-AZ(up to 3 for HA)
		Automatic recovery from common Apache Kafka failures
		Data is stored on EBS volumes for as long as you want
	MSK Serverless
		Run Apache Kafka on MSK without managing the capacity
		MSK automatically provisions resources and scales compute & storage
==============================================================================
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
	Let's you easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS Certificates
	Used for provide in-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS)
	Supports both public and private TLS certificates
	Free of charge for public TLS certificates
	Automatic TLS certificate renewal 
	Integration with (load TLS certificates on)
		Elastic Load Balancers
		CloudFront Destributions
		APIs on API Gateway
=====================================================================================
AWS AooConfig
	Configure, validate and deploy dynamic configuratuins
	Deploy dynamic configuration changes to your applicationsindependently of any code deployments
		you don't need to restart the application
	Feature flags, application tuning, allow/block listing...
	Use with apps on EC2 instances, Lambda, ECS, EKS...
	Gradually deploy the configuration changes and rollback if issues occur
	Validate configuration changes before deployment using:
		JSON Schema (syntactic check) or 
		Lambda Function - run code to perform validation (semantic check)
==============================================================================================
CloudWatch Evidently
	Safely validate new features by serving them to a specified % of your users
		Reduce risk and identify unintended consequences
		Collect experiment data, analyze using stats, monitor performance
	Launches (= feature flags): enable and disable features for a subset of users
	Experiments (=A/B testing) : compare multiple versions of the same feature
	Overrides: ore-define a variation for a specific user 
	Store evaluation events in CloudWatch Logs or S3
=================================================================================================
