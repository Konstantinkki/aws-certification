should know in depth for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associated & AWS Certified SysOps Administrator

At the AWS Certified Developer Level, you should know about:
	VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NATGateways
	Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
	VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
	Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect

============================================================

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) & Subnets Primer
	VPC : private network to deploy your resources (regional resources)
	Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
	A public subnet  is a subnet that is accessible from internet
	A private subnet is a subnet, that is not accessible from the internet
	To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables

=============================================================
Internet Gateway & Nat Gateway 
  'Internet Gateway' helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
  Public sublets have a route to the internet gateway
  'Nat Gateways' (AWS-managed) & 'Nat Instances' (self managed) allow you instances in your 'Private Subnets' to access the internet while remaining private

============================================================

Network ACL(Access Control List) & Security Groups
  NACL (Network ACL)
	a firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
	Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	Are attached at the Subnet laval 
	Rules only include IP
  Security Groups 
	A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
	Can have only ALLOW rules 
	Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

============================================================

Network ACLs vs Security Groups

       Security Group                                         Network ACL
Operates at the instance level                        Operates at the subnet level
Supports allow rules only			      Supports allow and deny rules
is stateful : Return traffic is auto allowed          is stateless: return traffic must be explicity allowed by rules
  regardless of any rules			 
We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to      We process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic
  allow traffic
Applies to an instance only if someone specifies      Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets it's associated with 
  the security group when launching the instance,     (therefore, you don't have to rely on users zto specify the security group)
  or associate the security group with the instance
  later on
   
=============================================================
VPC Flow Logs
  Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	VPC Flow Logs
	Subnet Flow logs
	Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
  Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues, Example: 
	Subnets to Internet
	Subnets to subnets
	Internet to Subnet
  Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc...
  VPC Flow logs datacan go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehouse

============================================================
VPC Peering
  Connect two VPC, privately using AWS' network
  Make them behave as if they were in the same network
  Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
  VPC Peering connection is 'not transitive' (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another) 

============================================================
VPC Endpoints
  Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Service using a private network instead of the public WWW network
  This gives you enchanced security and lower latenct to access AWS services
  'VPC Endpoint Gateway' : S3 & DynamoDB
  'VPC Endpoint Interface' : the rest
  Only used within your VPC

============================================================
Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
  Site to Site VPN
	Connect an on-premisses VPN to AWS
	The connection is automatically encripted
	Goes over the public internet

  Dirrect Connection (DX)
	Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	The connection is private, secure and fast
	Goes over a private network
	Take at least a month to establish
		
=============================================================
VPC Closing comments
  VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
  Subnets:  Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
  Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
  Nat Gateway / Instance : give internet access to private subnets
  NACL : Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound 
  Security Groups : Statefull, operate at the EC2 instance level or ElasticNetworkInstance
  VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, non transitive
  VPC Endpoints : Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
  VPC Flow Logs: network traffic logs
  Site to Site VPN : VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS
  Direct Connect: direct private connection to AWS
