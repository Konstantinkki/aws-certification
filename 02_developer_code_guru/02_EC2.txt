EC2 - secure, resizable compute capacity in the Cloud
	Like a VM, only hosted in AWS instead of your own data center
	Designed to make-scale cloud computing easier for developers
	The capacity you want when you need it.
	You are in complete control of your own instances
--------------------
Game Changer - AWS led a big change in the industry by introducing EC2
Pay Only For What You Use - EC2 changes the economics of computing
No Wasted Capacity - Select the capacity that you need right now. Grow and shrink when you need 
--------------------

ON PREMISES INFRASTRUCTURE
Estimate Capacity
Long term investment, 3-5 years.
Expectation that the application will "grow-into" it.
Lots of wasted capacity
--------------------
WAIT minutes, not months

EBS Volumes : https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/volume-types/
=================================================================
EBS Volumes Exam Tips 
	Default Encryption - If encryption by default is set on your account by your account admin, you cannot create unencrypted EBS Volumes
	Encrypted Snapshots - If you can create an EBS volume from an encrypted snapshot, then you will get an encrypted volume
	Unencrypted Snapshots - If you create an EBS volume from an unencrypted snapshot, then encryption is only optional  
		if default encryption has not been set at account level by your acount admin.
====================================================================
ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
	A load balancer distributes network traffic across a group of servers
	We can easily increase capacity when needed
----------------------------------------------------------
Elastic Load balancer
	Application LB - HTTP HTTPS
	Network LB - TCP and high performance
	Classic - http/https/ tcp - LEGACY!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Gateway Load Balancer
	Allows you to load balance workloads for xthird-party virtual appliances running in AWS, such as:
		Virtual appliances purchased using the AWS merketplace
		Virtual firawalls from companies like FortItet, Palo Alto, Juniper, Cisco
		IDS/IPS system from companies like CheckPoint, Trend Micro, etc
------------------------------------------
ALB 
	Used for load balancing HTTP/HTTPS trafic. They operate at Layer 7 and are application-aware
	They support advanced request routing to specific web servers based on the HTTP header
-------------------------------------------
7 Layer Model
	What is it?
		A conseptual framework which describes the functions of a network.
		Beginning with the application layer, which directly serves the end user, down to the physical layer

Layer 7 (Application) - What the end user sees, HTTP, web browseer
Layer 6 (Presentation) - Data is in a usable format. Encryption, SSH
Layer 5 (Session) - Maintains connections and sessions
Layer 4 (Transport) - Transmit data using TCP and UDP
Layer 3 (Network) - Logically routes packets, based on IP address
Layer 2 (Data Link) - Physically transmits data based on MAC addresses.
Layer 1 (Physical) - Transmits bits and bytes over physical devices
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Load Balancer
	High Performance - used for load balancing TCP traffic where extwreme performance is required
	Operating at Layer 4(Transport Layer)
	Capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies
	As it is high performance, it is also the most expensive option
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Classic LB - OLD LEGACY
	Legacy - Classic LB are the legacy option but may still appear in the exam
	HTTP/HTTPS - Supports Layer 7 - specific features such as X-Forwarded-for headers and sticky sessions.
	TCP - Supports Layer 4 load balancing for applications that rely purely on the TCP protocol
---------------------------------------------------------------------
X-Forwarded-For Header
	Identity the Originating IP address of a client connecting through a load balancer
---------------------------------------
Common LB Errors
	504 - Gateway Timeout - target failed to respond
	CHECK YOUR APPLICATION
		The ELB could not establish a connection to zthe target e.g. the web server, database, or lambda function
		Your application is having issues
	Identify where the application is failing and fix the problem
--------------------------------------------
Elastic LB Exam tips
	Applicatio LB 
	Network LB
	Classic LB
	Gateway LB
	X-Forwarded-For - if you need the IPv4 address of your and user, look for the X-Forwarded-For header
===========================================

Route 53  Exam Tips
	Launch an EC2 Instance + install httpd
	Create an Application LB + configure our EC2 instance as a target
	Configure a Route 53 ALias + Map a friendly domain name to our ALB. So we can access our website using our own domain name

 AWS CLI
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html
	https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/index.html
------------------------------------------------
AWS CLI Exam Tips
	Lease Privilege - Always give your users minimum amount of access required to do their job
	Use Groups - Create IAM groups and assign your users to groups. Group permissions are assigned using IAM policy documents
	Secret Access Key - you will only see this once! if you lose it - delete and create again, and recobfigure CLI
	Don't share Kay Pairs
	Supports Linux Windows MacOs
-----------------------------------------------
AWS Cli Pagination
	You can control the number if items included in the output when you run a CLI command
	By default, the AWS CLI uses a page size of 1000
	i.e. If you run 'aws s3api list-objects my_bucket' - on a bucket which contains 2500 objects, the CLI actually makes 3 APIcalls to S3... 
		but displays the entire output in one go.
-----------------------------------------------
CLI Pagination Errors
	If you see errors when running list commands on a lerger number of resources, the default page size of 1000 might be too long
	You are most likely to see a 'timed out' error, because the API call has exceedrd the maximum allowed time to fetch the required result

FIX :
	To fix this, use the '--page-size' option to have the CLI request a smaller number if items from each api call 
		- WILL GET ALL ITEMS WITH (all/page-size) COUNT OF CALLS
	
	The CLI still retrives the full list, but performs a larger number of APIcalls in the background and retrives a smaller number of items with each call
	
	Use the '--max-items' option to return fewer items in the CLI output  WILL RETURN ITEMS COUNT = max-items
------------------------------------------------
Exam tips
	If you do see errors like 'timed out' or errors related to too many results being returned:
		Ajust the pagination in of CLI results to avoid errors generated by too many results
		aws s3api list-objects --bucket my-bucket --page-size = 100
	Teh CLI still retrives the full list, but performs a larger number of API calls in the background 
		and retrives a smaller number of items with each call
===================================================
WORKING WITH AWS CLOUDSHELL 
	can run from AWS console
	Linux terminal
	Can run commands
=======================================================
Launch an EC2 instance with an S3 role demo
	1. create IAM role with S3 access
	2. Create EC2 Instance and attach a role 
	3. Access S3 from EC2 Instance
-------------------------------------------------------
      aws configure list

      aws s3 ls
      aws s3 mb s3://kostestembhz
      echo 'sfasfdsafdfd' > file.txt
      aws s3 cp file.txt s3://kostestembhz
-------------------------------------------
Exam Tips
	The Prefered Option - Roles are prefered from a security perspective.
	Avoid Hard Coding Your Credentials - Roles allow you to provide access without the use of access key IDs and secret access keys
	Policies - Policies controll a role's permissions
	Updated - You can update a policy attached toa role, and it will take immediate effect
	Attaching and Detaching  - You can attache and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate these instances
======================================================
RDS - Relational Databases 
	Tables - Data organized into tables Thanks of a tradittional apreadsheet
	Rows - The data items
	Columns - The fields in the database
--------------
When would we use an RDS database  ?
	RDS is generally used for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) workloads
----------
SQL Server
Oracle
MySql
PostgresSql
MariaDB
Aurora
-----------------------------
Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) vs Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)

OLTP
	Processes data from transactions in real time e.g. customer orders, banking, transactions, payments, and booking systems.
	OLTP is all about data procssing, and completing large numbers of small transactions in real time

OLAP
	Processes complex queries to analyze historical data, e.g. analyzing net profit figures from the past 3 years, and sales forecasting.
	OLAP is all about data analyzis using large amounts of data, and complex queries that take a long time to complete
-----------------------------
Exam tips
	RDS Database Types 
	RDS for OLTP workloads
	Not Suitable for OLAP
---------------------------------
RDS DEMO
	1. Launch an RDS Instance using the AWS console
	2. Launch an EC2 Instance - Install a MySql database client
	3. Connect to the RDS Instance - Connect from EC2 using teh MySql db Client
=================================
Multi AZ  & Read Replicas
	For Disaster Recovery not for improve performance !!! you cannot connect to the Standby when Primary DB is active
	It's an exact copy of your production database in another AZ
	AWS handles the replication for you
		When you write to your production database, this write will automatically synchronize to the atandby database
-------------------------------
Which RDS Types Can be configured as Multi-AZ ?
	SQL Server
	Oracle
	MySql 
	PostgresSql
	MariaDB
-------------------------------
Read Replicas - for improve performance read only copy of primary DB
	may be locates in same AZ or be a cross AZ or cross Region
	Allows up to 5 Read Replicas
----------------------------
RDS Multi-AZ and Read Replica Exam Tips
	Multi AZ :	
		An Exact copy of your production db in another AZ 
	        Used for DR
		In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically failover to the standby instance
	Read Replica:
		A read-only copy of your primary db in the same AZ, cross AZ, cross-region
		Used to increase ir scale read performance
		Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database for read-only workloads e.g. Business Intelligence reporting jobs
==============================
RDS BAckups and snapshorts
	Types of RDS BAckup
	    Two ways to Backup RDS
		1.Database snapshot - Manual ad-hoc, and user initiated. It provides a snapshot of the storage volume attached to the DB instance
		2. Automated Backup - Enabled by default. It creates daily backups or snapshots that run during a backup window that you define
			Transaction logs are used to replay transactions
------------------------------
RDS Auto Backup
	1. Point-in-time Recovery - Recover your database to any point in time within a 'retention period' of 1-35 days
	2. Fully Daily Backup - RDS takes a full daily backup, or snapshot, and also stores transaction logs throughout the day
	3.The Recovery Process - When you do a recovery, AWS will first choose the most recent daily backup and than apply transaction logs 
		relevant to the recovery point

Example : dayly backup in time (2-5 am)  + Transaction logs with all updates = we can restore backup + execute all from transaction backup (restore for any time)


	Stored In S3 - Auto backup and snapshots are stored in S2
	Free storage - you ge free storage space equal to the size of your database. So if you have an RDS instance of 10 Gb, yuo will get 100Gb wotrth of storage
	Defined Backup Windows - During the backup window, storage IO may be suspended for a few seconds while the backup process initializes, and you may 
		experience increased latency at this time
-----------------------------------
Restoring RDS DB
	The restored version of the db will always be a new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint.
----------------------------------------
Encryption at Rest
	Enabling Encryption
		Enable encryption at creation time by selecting the encryption option in the console
	Integrated with KMS
		Encryption is done using the AWS KMService AES-256 encryption
	Include All DB Storage
		Includes all the underlying storage, automated backups, snapshots, logs, and read replicas
-----------
You can't enable encryption on an unencrypted RDS DB Instance
	Unencrypted DB --->Snapshot---->Encrypted Snapshot----> Encrypted DB
-------------------------------------
Backup  and Snapshot Exam Tips
	Automated Backup:
		Automated, enabled by default, you define the backup window 
		Point in time snapshot + transaction logs
		Retention period of 1-35 days
		Can be used to recover your database to any point in time within the retention period

	DB Snapshot
		User initiated, ad-hoc
		Point in time - snapshot only
		No retention period; stored indefinitely
		Used to back up your DB instance to a known state and restore to that specific state at any time, e.g. before making a change to the DB
----------------------------------------
RDS Encryption Exam tips
	1 Enable at Creation - includes all underlying storage, auto backups, snapshots, logs and read replicas
	2 KMS Integration - uses the KMS service for AES-256 encryption
	3 Existing RDS Instance - Take a snapshot, encrypt the snapshot, then create a new RDS instance from the encrypted snapshot
==========================
Increasing Scalability with RDS Proxy:
	How RDS Proxy works
	RDS Proxy Fault Tolerance
	Other Use Cases
	Exam Tips
------------------------
RDS Proxy - pools and shares database connections to assist with application scalability and database efficiency
------------------------
Increase Application Availability
	Serverless and scales automatically - to your workload throuhg pooling and sharing database connections
	Preserves application connections - during failover
	Detects failover and routes requests - to standby quickly
	Deployable over multi-AZ for protection - from infrastructure failure
	Up to 66% faster failover times
----------------------------
Other Use Cases
	Applications :
		with unpredictable workloads
		that open/close database connections infrequently
		that require availability through transient failures
		with open but idle connections
=========================================
ELASTICACHE
	1. In-memeory Cache (key Value) - ElastiCache makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud
	2. Improves Database Performance - It allows you to retrive information from fast, in-memory cache instead of slower disk-based storage
	3. Great for Read-Heavy Database Workloads - Caching the results of I/O intensive database queries. Also for storing session data for distributed applications
--------------------------------------
Types of ElastiCache:
	1. yMemcached : 
		Great for basic object caching.
		Scales Horizontally, but there is no persistance, Muli-AZ or failover
		A good choice if you just want basic caching and you want your caching model to ba as simple as possible

	2. Redis:
		A more sophisticated solution with enterprise features like persistence, replication, Multi-AZ, and failover.
		Supports sorting and ranking data (e.g. for gaming leaderboards), and complex data types like lists and hashes
------------------------------------------
Typical Scenario
	1. Database under stress - You will be given a scenario where a particular database is under a lot of stress
	2. Find a solution  - You may be asked which service you should use to alleviate this
	3. Know when to use ElasriCache - is a good choice if your database is particulary read-heavy and not prone to frequent changing
----------------------------
When ElastiCache Can't Help
	1. Heavy Write Loads - yCaching will not help allieviate heavy write loads, so you may need to scale up your database
	2. OLAP Queries - If your database is feeling stress because you are performing Online Analytical Processing. Think about RedShift instead
----------------------------
ElastiCache Exam Tips
	EC - is an in-memory cache designed to improve read performance for read-heavy databases.
	
	Memcached :
		in-memory, key value data store
		Object Caching is your primary goal
		You want to keep things as simple as possible
		You don't need persistance or multi AZ
		You don't need to support advanced data types or sorting

	Redis:
		in-memory, key-value data store
		You are performing data sorting and ranking, such as gaming leaderboards.	
		You have advanced data types, such as liat or hashes
		You need multi AZ
================================
MemoryDB for Redis
	What is MemoryDB for Redis?
	What is suitable For?
	MemoryDB vs, ElastiCache
	Exam tips
-----------------------------
What is MemDB for Redis?
	Massive Scalable - in-memory database (GB to > 100TB)
	Highly Available - Multi-AZ Transaction log recovery and durability
	Primary Database - The entire dataset for an application can be stored in memory (instead of a database plus a cache).
	Ultra-fast performance - Supports > 160 million requests per second. Microsecond read and single-digit millisecond write latency.
-----------------------------
MemoryDB for Redis Suitable Uses
	1. Workloads - Requiring an ultra-fast, Redis - compatible primary database
	2. Applications - Data-intensive, low latency applications that also require high scalability
	3. High Performance - Applications that need an in-memory database to handle millions of requests per second
	4. Microservices - Highly scalable microservices architecture
----------------------------
What's the difference?
	They are both in-memory data stores that help applications to access data 2faster than reading from disk
	
	ElastiCache for Redis:
		Database Cache - in-memory database cacheservice. Sits in front of a database like RDS.
		FAST BUT NOT ULTRA-FAST - Milliseconds read latency.
		USE CASE - A website that needs to store session data for its customers.
	
	MemoryDB for Redis
		PRIMARY DATABASE - Reduce complexity by removing the need for a database plus a cache.
		ULTRA-FAST PERFORMANCE - Microseconds read and single-digital millisecond write latency.
		USE CASE - An Online gamming company with millions of users sharing digital assets

Ec2 Image builder
	What is EC2 Image builder
	Why is it so cool?
	How does it works
	Terminology	
	Exam Tips
-------------------------------------------
What is EC2 Image Builder?
	Create EC2 Images - virtual machine images (AMIs) and Container Images
	Simple to use - Graphical interface.
	Validate Your Images - Test and validate images, e.g. for security compliance and functionality, using AWS provided tests or your own custom tests.
-------------------------------------------
Why Is It Cool ?
	EC2 image builder automates the process of creating and maintaining your images.
	  When software updates are available, Image builder can automatically create a new image, run validation tests on the new image, 
	  and make it available it to the AWS regions of your choice
	
	Image builder allows you to share your AMIs with other AWS accounts that you own
--------------------------------------------
How does it works?
	1. Base OS - provide a base OS image, e.g. Amazon Linux 2 AMI
	2. Software - Define software to install, e.g. .NET, Node.js, Python, latest security updates, latest kernel, security settings.
	3. Test - Run tests on the new image. For example, does it boot correctly?
	4. Distribute - destribute the image to the regions of your choice (by default, the region you are operating in).
-------------------------------------------
EC2 Image Builder Terminology
	Image Pipeline - "Defines the configuration" and end-to-end process of building images. Including the image recipe, distribution and test settings
	Image Recipe - "Image builder" creates a recipe for each image, which can be shared,  version controlled, and reused
		Example : "Source image" - Amazon Linux 1 AMI
		          "Build Components" - Apache Tomcat
	Build Components - "The software components" to include in the image.
-------------------------------------------
Exam Tips
	1. EC2 Image Builder Automates the process of creating and maintaining AMI and Container images.
	2. 4-step process - Select a base OS image, customize by adding software, test and distribute to your chosen region.
	3. Terminology: 
		- Image pipeline:  settings and process
		- Image recipe: Source image and build components
		- Build components: The software to include
==============================================
Creating an AMI using EC2 image builder
	1. Create an IAM Role - add permisions for EC2 Image Builder
	2. Create an Image Pipeline - This is where we'll define our configuration settings.
	3. Execute the pipeline - Notice Image Builder launches temporary "build" and "test" EC2 instances
	4. View the Image - We can view the image in image Builder and from the EC2 console under AMIs

An AMI only exists in a single Region - You can only use it in the Region it belongs to.
	If you have an AMI in us-east-1 that you want to use in us-east2, ypu'll need to create a copy for us-east-2
-----------------------------------------
Copying scenarious:
	Unencrypted  AMI to Unencrypted AMI - TRUE
	Encrypted to Encrypted - TRUE
	Unencrypted to Encrypted - TRUE
	Encrypted to Unencrypted - FALSE

By default "if you do not specify encryption parameters" the AMI is copied with its original encryplion status 
==========================================
SUMMARY : 
	EC2 is like a VM that is hosted in AWS Instead of your data center
		1. Select the capacity that you need right now.
		2. Grow and shink when you need.
		3. Pay for that you use
		4. Wait minutes, not months
-----------------------------------------
Pricing Options:
	1. On-Demand - Pay by the hour or the second depending on the type of instance you run. Great for flexibility.
	2. Reserved - reserve capacity for 1-3 years. Up to 72% discounton the hourly charge. Great if you have known, fixed requirements
	3. Spot - Purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Prices fluctuate with supply and demand. Great for applications with flexible start/end times
	4. Dedicated - A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Great if you have server-bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements.
-----------------------------------------
Determines the hardware of the host computer.
	Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities. These types are grouped in instance families.
	Select an instance type based on the requirements of yuor application.
-----------------------------------------

EBS Snapshot Exam Tips : 
	1. EBS Snapshots - A point-in-time copy of an EBS volume. Great for backing up EBS volumes. You can use a snapshot to create a new EBS Volume.
	2. Encrypted snapshots - If you create a new EBS volume from an encrypted snapshot, then you will get an encrypted volume.
	3. Unencrypted snapshot - If you create a new EBS volume from an unencrypted snapshot, then you will get an unencrypted volume
----------------------------------------------
Elastic Load Balancer Exam TIps:
	ALB - inteligent load balancing for HTTP/HTTPS. Routes requests to a specific web server based on request type
	Network LB - Provides High performance load balancing for TCP traffic
	Classic LB - Teh legacy option that supports both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP. May still appear in the exam.
	Gateway LB - Provides load balancing for third-party virtual applications
	X-Forwarded-For if you need the IPv4 address of your and user, look for the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header
	504 Error - Gateway timeout. The application is not responding within the timeout period.	Troubleshoot your application or database server.
----------------------------------------------
Route 53 Exam Tips
	Route 53 - Amazon's DNS service.
	Map a Domain Name - EC2 Instance, Elastic Load Balancer, S3 Bucket
	Route 53 Terminology - 
		"Hosted Zone" - A container for DNS records for your domain.
		"Alias" - Allows you to route traffic addressed to the zone apex, or the top of the DNS namespace e.g. cloud.com 
			  and send it to a resource within AWS, e.g. an Elastic LB
		"A Record" - Allows you to route traffic to a resource, such as a web server, using an IPv4 address
---------------------------------------------------------------
AWS CLI Exam tips
	Least Privilege
	Use groups
	Secret access Key - weill see only once - command in cli = aws configure 
	Don't share Key PAirs
	Supports Linux, Windows, MacOS
----------------------------------------------------------------
Using Roles with EC2 - Exam Tips
	Roles can be used to give EC2 instances access to AWS resources like S3.
	1. Create IAM Role - With S3 access
	2. Create an EC2 Instance - Attach the role we just created
	3. Access S3 - try to access s3 from our EC2 instance
	Predered option - Roles are preferred from a security perspective.
	Avoid Hard Coding Your Credentials - Roles allows you to provide access without having to manage access key IDs and secret access keys.
	Policies - Policies control a roles permissions
	Updates - You can update a policy attached to a role, and it will take immediate effect.
	Attaching and Detaching - you can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate these instances.
----------------------------------------------------------------
RDS Exap Tips
	1. RDS Database Types - SQLServer, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora.
	2. RDS is for OLTP Workloads - Great for processing lots of small transactions, like customer orders, banking transactions, payments, and booking systems
	3. Not Suitable For OLAP - Use RedShift for OLAP and data warehousing tasks like analyzing large amounts of data, reporting, and sales forecasting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Backup vs Snapshot Exap tipsz
	Auto backup 
	1. Automated enabled by default, you define the backup window.
	2. Point-in-time snapshot plus transaction logs
	3. Retention period of up to 35 days.
	4. Can be used to recover your database to any point in time within the retention period

	DB Snapshot
	1. User-initiated, ad-hoc.
	2. Point-in-time snapshot only.
	3. No retention period; stored indefinitely.
	4. Used to back up your DB instance to a known state and restore to that specific state at any time, e.g. before making a change to the database
--------------------------------------------------------------
RDS Encryption Exam tips 
	1. Enable at Creation - includes all underlying storage, automated backups, snapshots, logs, and read replicas.
	2. KMS Integration - Uses the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) service for AES-256 bit encryption
	3. Existing RDS Instances = Take a snapshot, encrypt the snapshot, than create a new RDS instance from the encrypted snapshot
--------------------------------------------------------------
Multi AZ and Read Replica Exam tips 
	Multi AZ:
	1. An exact copy of your production database in another Availability Zone.
	2. Used for disaster recovery.
	3. In teh event of a failure, RDS will automatically failover to the standby instance.
	
	Read Replica:
	1. A read-only copy of ypur primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ, or cross-region.
	2. Used to increase or scale read performance.
	3. Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load of your primary database for read-only workloads, e.g. BUsiness intelligence reporting jobs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ElastiCache Exam Tips
	ElastiCache is an in-memory cache designed to improve read performance for read-heavy databases.

	Memcache:
	1. In-memory, key-value data store
	2. Object caching is your primary goal 
	3. You want to keep things as simple as possible
	4. You don't need persistance or Multi-AZ
	5. You don't need to support advanced data types of sorting

	Redis:
	1. in-memory, key-value data store
	2. you are performing data sorting and ranking, such as gaming leaderboards.
	3. you have advanced data types, such as list and hashes.
	4. You need data persistance.
	5. You need Multi-AZ
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter Store - Exam Tips
	Store Confidential Information - Passwords, database connection strings, licensecodes, etc.
	Plain text or Encrypted - You can store values as plain text or encrypt them
	Reference - You can reference your parameters using the parameter name, e.g. in a bootstrap script
	Integrated with aws Services - You can use Parameter Store with EC2, CloudFormation, Lambda, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy
-------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS Secrets Manager Exam Tips
	Secrets Manager
	1. Database Credentials
	2. API Keys
	3. Supports Rotation
