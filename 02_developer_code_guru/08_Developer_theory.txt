Introduction To CI/CD
	What is CI/CD
		1. Software Development Best Practice - Continuous Integration, Continious Delivery / Deployment
		2. Make Small Changes & Automate Everything - Small, incremental code changes. Automate as much as possible e.g. 
			code integration, build test and deployment
		3. Why Is It so Cool ?  - Modern companies like AWS, Netflix, Google and FB have pioneered this approach to releasing code, 
			successfully applying thousands of changes per day.
------------------
Benifits  of the CI/CD Approach
	1. Automation Is Good - Fast, repeatable2, scalable, enables rapid deployment
	2. Manual is Bad! - Slow, error prone, inconsistent, unscalable, complex.
	3. Small Changes - Test each code change and catch bugs while they are small and simple to fix.
------------------
CI Workflow 
	1. Shared Code Repository  - Multiple developers contributing to a shared code repository like Git. Frequently merging or Integrating code updates.
	2. Automated Build - When changes appear in the code repository this triggers an automated build of the new code.
	3. Automated Test - Tun automated tests to check the code locally before it is commited into the master code repository.
-----------------
Continuous Delivery & Deployment Workflow 
	1. Code Is Merged - after successful tests, the code gets merged to the master repo.
	2. Prepared for deployment - Code is build, tested and packaged for deployment.
	3. Manual Decision - Humans may by involved in the decision to deploy the code. This is known as 'Continuous Delivery'
	4. Or fully Automated - The system automatically deploys the new code as soon as it has been prepared for deployment. 
		This is known as 'Continuous Deployment'
----------------
AWS Developer tools
	1. CodeCommit - source & version control - Source control service enabling teams co collaborate on code, html pages, scripts, images and binaries
	2. CodeBuild - Automated Build - Compiles source code, runs tests and produces packages that are ready to deploy.
	3. CodeDeploy - Automated Deployment - Automates code deployments to any instance, including EC2, Lambda and on-premises.
	4. CodePipeline - Manages the workflow - End-to-end solution, build, test, and deploy your  application every time there is a code change.
----------------
Exam Tips
	1.CI - Inwtegrating or merging the code changes frequently - at least once per day Think - CodeCommit.
	2. Cont. Delivery - Automating the build, test and deployment functions. Think CodeBuild and CodeDeploy
	3. Cont. Deployment - Fully automated release process, code is deployed into Staging or Prod as soon as it has successfully passed through the
		release pipeline. Think CodePipeline.
---------------
AWS Whitepaper : 
	Practicing Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment on AWS
	Explains the features and benefits of using continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) and AWS tooling in your software development env.
==================
CodeDeploy 101 - Automated deployment EC2 instances, on-premises & lambda
	Quickly release new features. Avoid downtime during deployments.
	Avoid the risk associated with manual process
------------------
Code deploy Deployment Approaches
	1. In-Place - The application is stopped on each instance and the new release is installed. Also known as a Rolling Update.
	2. Blue/Green - New Instances are provisioned and the new release is installed on the new instances. Blue represents the active deployment, 
			green is the new release.
------------------
Example In-Place Deployment: (one by one)
	CodeDeploy installs the new version, known as a Revision
	The instance comes back into service.
	CodeDeploy continues to deploy to the next instance.
-----------------
How to Roll Back?
	If you change your mind, there's no quick fix!
	With an In-Place deployment you'll need to re-deploy the previous version which may be time consuming.
----------------
Blue/Green Deployment
	The Green(new) instances are registered with the Elastic Load Balancer.
	Traffic is routed away from the old env.
	The Blue env. is eventually terminated (after green is was tested)
---------------
Roll Back Blue/Green - 
	Easy to Switch between the old and new releases.
        Only works if you didn't already terminate your old env.
---------------
Exam Tips
	In-Place :
		Capacity is reduced during the deployment.
		Lambda is not supported.
		Rolling Back involves a re-deploy
		Great for deploying the first time
	Blue/Green :
		No capacity reduction.
		Green instances can be created ahead of time.
		Easy to switch between old and new .
		You pay for 2 envs untill you terminate the old servers.
=================
Configuring CodeDeploy using The AppSpec File
	1. Configuration file - Defines the parameters to be used during a CodeDeploy deployment.
	2. EC2 - For EC2 and on-permises systems, Yaml only
	3. Lambda - Yaml and JSON supported. Filestructure depends on whether you are deploying to Lambda or EC2
----------------
EC2 AppSpec File Structure
	1. Version - Reserved for future use - Currently the allowed value is 0.0.
	2. OS - Operating System Version - The OS version you are using, e.g. linux, windows
	3. files - configuration files, packages - The location of any app files that need to be copied and where they should be copied to.
	4. hooks - lifecycle event hooks - Scripts which need to run at set points in the deployment lifecycle. Hooks have a very specific run order.
----------------
Scrypts You Might Run During A Deployment
	1. Uzip Files - UnZip application files prior to deployment.
	2. Run Tests - Run functional tests on a newly deployment application.
	3. Deal With Load Balancing - De-register and re-register instances with a load balancer.
----------------
Typical Folder setup:
	appspec.yml
	/Scripts
	/Config
	/Source
	The appspec.yml must be placed in the root of the directory of your Revision, otherwise the deployment will fail.
----------------
Exam Tips:
	1. Configuration File - Defines the parameters to be used by CodeDeploy e.g. OS, file, hooks.
	2. appspec.yml - Should be saved in the root of your revision
	3. Hooks - Lifecycle event hooks have a very specific run order.
================
CodeDeploy Lifecycle Event Hooks
	1. BeforeInstall
	2. AfterInstall
	3. ApplicationStart
	4. ValidationService
---------------
All in-place Deployment Run Order
	Before - Tasks you want to run on instances Before they are de-registered from a Load Balancer
	Block - De-register instances from a Load Balancer
	After - Tasks you want to run on instances after they are de-registered from a Load Balancer

	ApplicationStop
	DownloadBundle
	BeforeInstall
	Install
	AfterInstall
	ApplicationStart
	ValidateService
	
===============
Code Pipeline 
	A fully Managed CI/CD Service 
	1. Orchestrates Build, Test & Deployment - The pipeline is triggered every there is a change to your code. Like a conductor in a orchestra
	2. Automated Release Process - Fast, consistent, fewer mistakes. Enables quick release of new features and bug fixes.
	3. CodePipeline integrates with : CodeCmmit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Github, Jenkins, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, Lambda, Elastic Container Service
---------------
Example CodePipeline Workflow
	1. CodePipeline - Workflow is Defined - The workflow begins when there is a change detected in your source code.
	2. CodeCommit - New Code Appears - new source code appears in the CodeCommit repository
	3. CodeBuild - Code is Built & Tested - CodeBuild immediately compiles source code, run tests and produces packages.
	4. CodeDeploy - Application Deployed - the newly built application is deployed into a staging or prod env.
---------------
CodePipeline Exam Tips
	1. CI/CD service - Orchestrates your end-to-end software release process based on a workflow you define.
	2. Automated - Automatically triggers your pipeline as soon as a change is detected in your code repo.
	3. Integrates With AWS & Third-Party tools - CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, Github, Jenkins, Elastic beanstalk, CloudFormation, Lambda, Elastic Container Service
===============
Code Pipeline Example : 
	Architecture overview
	    Task breakdown
		1. Use CloudFormation to create an ec2 instance
		2. Upload version 1 of our app to S3
		3. Deploy the app using CodeDEploy
		4. Build a CodePipeline and deploy version 2.
		5. Configure an automated pipeline and deploy version 3
===============
Code Artifact
	What is CodeArtifact?
	What Are Artifacts?
	Integrating with Public Repositories
	Exam Tips
----------------
What is CodeArtifact ? - An artifact reository that makes it easy for developers to find the software packages they need.
	Artifact Repository - Securely store, publish and share
	Software Packages - Used in your software development process. A package is a bundle of software.
	Including Open-Source - Open-source software from public repositories, as well as software developed in-house.
----------------
A central repository that can be used by all your developers to obtain the correct version of the software packages required for their projects

public repos ========> CodeArtifact =========> developer
npm Registry                                   CI/CD Systems (CodeBuild)
python Package Index	
Maven Central
----------------
What are artifacts? 
	Documentation
	Compiled applications
	Deployable packages
	Libwraries
----------------
AWS CodeArtifact - Integration with Public Repositories
	Third-Party Software - Makes third-party software available for use (e.g., open-source packages from public repositories like npm Registry)
	Approved Packages - IT leaders can make 'approved' packages available. Often this means the version that our engineering team is willing to support.
	Efficient - Developers know where to find approved packages and can also publish and share their own packages by adding them to the repository.
---------------
CodeArtifact Exam Tips
	An 'artifact repository' that makes it easy for developers to find the 'software packages' they need
	1. PAckage - A bundle of software used in your software dev process
	2. Approved - Developers can packages and can also publish their own
	3. External connection - Create an 'upstream repository' with an 'external connection' to pull packages from an iexternal 'public repo' (npm Registry for Node.js packages)
===============
Code Artifact - Integrating with Oublic Repositories
	1. Create a Domain - Create a repository (my-repo) and an upstream repository (npm-store).
	2. Add an External Connection - Connect npm-store to the 'public npm registry'
	3. Associate the Upstream Repo - 'Associate' npm-store with my-repo
	4. Install a Package - Use the npm CLI to 'install' the Express 'package' into my-repo.
--------------
 Example : 
***** Please note that if the command seems to hang and the command prompt does not reappear after running any of these commands, type the letter q in the CloudShell, your prompt will return and you can continue entering the next command **** 

1) Create a domain:
aws codeartifact create-domain --domain my-domain

2) Create a repository in your domain:
aws codeartifact create-repository --domain my-domain --repository my-repo

3) Create an upstream repository for your my-repo repository:
aws codeartifact create-repository --domain my-domain --repository npm-store

4) Add an external connection to the npm public repository to your npm-store repository:
aws codeartifact associate-external-connection --domain my-domain --repository npm-store --external-connection "public:npmjs"

5) Associate the npm-store repository as an upstream repository to the my-repo repository:
aws codeartifact update-repository --repository my-repo --domain my-domain --upstreams repositoryName=npm-store

6) Configure the npm package manager with your my-repo repository (fetches an authorization token from CodeArtifact using your AWS credentials):
aws codeartifact login --tool npm --repository my-repo --domain my-domain

7) Use the npm CLI to install an npm package. For example, to install the popular npm package express, use the following command, if we don’t specify a version, this command will install the latest version available in the external repo:
npm install express

(express is a Node.js web application framework used to develop web and mobile applications)

8) View the package you just installed in your my-repo repository:
aws codeartifact list-packages --domain my-domain --repository my-repo


You now have three CodeArtifact resources:
* The domain my-domain.
* The repository my-repo that is contained in my-domain. This repository has an npm package available to it.
* The repository npm-store that is contained in my-domain. This repository has an external connection to the public npm repository and is associated as an upstream repository with the my-repo repository.

9) To avoid further AWS charges, delete the resources you created:
aws codeartifact delete-repository --domain my-domain --repository my-repo
aws codeartifact delete-repository --domain my-domain --repository npm-store
aws codeartifact delete-domain --domain my-domain

***** Please note that if the command seems to hang and the command prompt does not reappear after running any of these commands, type the letter q in the CloudShell, your prompt will return and you can continue entering the next command **** 
========================
Elastic Container Service
	Containers  - Similar to a virtual machine, more like a virtual operating environment.
	Standardized - A standardized unit with everything the software needs to run e.g. libraries, system tools, code and runtime
	Microservices - Applications are created using independent stateless components or microservices running in containers.
	Docker or Windows Containers - Use Docker to create Linux containers and Windows containers for windows workloads

	https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/DevOps/running-containerized-microservices-on-aws.pdf
	https://12factor.net/
-----------------------
Architecture Of A Docker Container 
	container = Code + Libs + VirtualKernel
	need : 
		Installed Docker
		OperaTING System
----------------------
Advantages of Containers & Microservices Architecture
	Highly Scalable - If y=the application becomes over loaded, scale only the services you need to.
	Fault Tolerannt - A single error in one of your containers shouldn't bring down your entire app.
	Easy TO Maintain - Easier to maintain, update and change than large monolithic applications.
----------------------
Where Does ECS Fit in ?
	What about ECS ? 
	1. A container orchestration service which supports Docker and Windows Containers.
	2. Quickly deploy and scale containerized workloads without having to install, configure, manage and scale your own orchestration platform.
	3. Similar to Kubernetes, BUT with deep integration with AWS services e.g. IAM, VPC, Route53
----------------------
Fargate Or EC2 ?
	1. Cluster of Virtual Machines - ECS will run your containers on cluster of virtual machines.
	2. Fargate for Serverless - Use Fargate for Serverless containers and you don't need to worry about the underlying EC2 instances!
	3. EC2 For More Control - If you want to control the instalation, configuration and managementof your compute environment.
---------------------
Introducing Elastic Container Registry
	ECR - Registry of container images
	ECS - downloads images from ECR and deploys a docker container
--------------------
Cool services which use ECS
	1. Amazon Segamaker - QUickly deploy and scale machine learning models for training and inference jobs
	2. Amazon Lex - Uses deep learning to build conversational interfaces e.g. chatbots.
	3. Amazon.com - Amazon's own recommendation engine is running on ECS
======================
Introduce to CloudFormation
	Manage, configure, and provision your AWS infrastructureas code.
	Resources are defined using a CloudFormation template.
	CloudFormation interprets the template and makes the appropriate API calls to create the resources you have defined.
	Supports YAML or JSON .
-------------------
CloudFormation Benefits:
	Consistent - Infrastructure is provisioned consistently, with fewer mistakes
	Quick and Efficient - Less time and effort than configuring things manually.
	Version Control - You can version control and peer review your templates.
	Free to use - Free to use but you are charged for the AWS resources you create using CF
	Manage Updates - Can be used to manage updates and dependencies
	Rolling Back - You can roll back to a previous state and delete the entire stack as well
-------------------
CF Process:
	1. Yaml or JSON Template - Yaml or JSON template used to describe the end state of the infrastructure you are either provisioning or changing
	2. S3 - After creating the template, you upload it to CF using S3.
	3. API Calls - CF reads and makes the API calls on your behalf
	4. CF Stachk - The resulting set of resources that CF builds from ypur template is called a "stack"
------------------
examples CF : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_TemplateQuickRef.html
1. The Resources Section is Mandatory - Resources is the only mandatory section of the CF template
2. The Transform Section is for Referencing Additional Code - The Transform section is used to reference additional code stored in S3, allowed for code re-use.
	E.g. Lambda code or template snippets/reusable pieces of CF code.
------------------
Exam tips
	1. Infrastructure as a code - CF allows you to manage, configure, and provision AWS infrastructure as YAML or JSON code
	2. Parameters - Input custon values.
	3. Conditions - E.g. provision resources based on environment.
	4. Resources - This section is mandatory and describes the AWS resources that CF will create.
	5. Mappings - Allows you to create custom mappings like Resion : AMI
	6. Transform - Allows you to reference code location in S3, e.g. Lambda code or reusable snippets of CF code.
====================
DEMO - Provisioning AWS resources using CF
	1. Create and Download an SSH Key Pair - Use this later to log in to an EC2 instance.
	2. Create a CF Stack - Use the provided template to provision an EC2 instance with SSH access enabled.
	3. Review Our CF Stack - identify the new instamce in the AWS console, and test that we can log in using SSH and the key pair we created at the beginning
===================
Exporting CF Stack Values:
  Example Scenario 
  Example Template : Export Values
  Example Template : Import Values
  Demo
  Exam Tips
-------------------
CF Stack : MetworkStack
vpc {
  publicSubnet {
    EC2
  }
  SG 
  Network ACL
  RouteTable 
  InternetGW
}

Outputs : 
	export : SubnetID
	export: SecurityGroupID

WebServerStack will get Ouputs as input
-------------------
1. Create new Stack  - Named NetworkStack
2. Outputs - Export SubnetId and SecurityGroupID
3. Create Another Stack - Use Fn::ImportValue to import the SubnetID and SecurityGroupID from NetworkStack
==================
Cloud Formation and SAM (Serverless Aplication Model)
	1. SAM - extension of CloudFormation for Serverless - The SAM is an extension to CF used to define Serverless applications.
	2. Simplified Syntax - SAM uses a simplified syntax for defining serverless resources: APIs, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, etc
	3. SAM CLI - Use the SAM CLI to package your deployment code, upload it to S3, and deploy your Serverless applications.
-----------------
Commands : 
	sam package --template-file ./mytemp.yml --output-template sam-template.yml --s3-bucket s3-bucket-name
	sam deploy  --template-file sam-template.yml --stack-name mystack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
---------
SAM DEMO:
	1. Use the AWS CloudShell (SAM is pre-installed)
	2. Create an S3 bucket
	3. Use sam package to package our code and save it to S3
	4. Use sam deploy to deploy a lambda function using CF
-----------------
CloudFormation Nested Stack
	'Enable re-use of CF code for common use cases'
	E.g. standard configuration for a load balancer, web server, or application server.
	Instead of copying out the code each time, create a standard template for each common use case and reference from within your CloudFormation template.
-----------------
Exam Tips : 
	Code re-use - Allows you to re-use your CF codeso you don't need to copy/past every time.
	Common Use Case - Really useful for frequently used configurations, e.g. load balancers, web or application servers.
	Stack Resource Type - Reference it in the Resources section of any CF template using the Stack resource type.
================
Introducing the CLoud Development Kit (CDK)
	what is the CDK ?
	How does it work ?
	CDK terminology
	Example code : TypeScript
	The Process
	Exam Tips
----------------
What is CDK ?
	Open-source software development framework
		Allows you to build applications, define, and 'deploy AWS resources' using a 'programming language' of your choice (ts, Py, Java, .NET, Go)
----------------
Terminology:
	App: Container for one or more stacks
	Stack : Unit of deployment
	Construct : defines the AWS resources
	
	CDK Toolkit (also known as the CDK CLI).
	The toolkit used to create and deploy using the CDK
----------------
The Process :
	cdk init - Create a new CDK Project : run 'cdk init' inside an empty directory
	npm run build - Compile the app : Use 'npm run build' to complete the app.
	cdk synth - Synthesize : Use 'cdk synth' to create a CF template
	cdk deploy - Deploy the Stack : use 'cdk deploy' to deploy the stack using CF
---------------
Introducing the CDK Exam Tips
	1. Deploy - Applications and AWS Resources - Use a 'programming language' of your choice
	2. Define - Apps, Stacks, Constructs - App=>Stack=>Construct
	3. Synthesize - CF Template - use the CDK CLI to create a 'CF Template' from your code and deploy it.
