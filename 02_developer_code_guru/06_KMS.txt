What is KMS? - AWS Key management Service
	Managed - Managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.	
	Integrated - Seamlesly integrated with many AWS services to make encrypting data in those services as easy as checking a box.
	Simple - With KMS, it is simple to encrypt your data with encryption keys that you manage.
---------------------
When do we use KMS? 
	whenever you are dealing with sensitive information.

	Sensitive data that you want to keep secret
	Customer Data
	Financial Data
	Database passwords
	Secrets
	Credentials
----------------------
KMS Integrates with : 
	S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, EBS, EFS, CloudTrial, Developer Tools
---------------------
What is a CMK
	1. Customer Master Key - Encrypt/decrypt data up to 4KB
	2. What is it User For? - Generate / encrypt / decrypt / the Data Key.
	3. Data Key - Used to encrypt / decrypt your data.
---------------------
Customer Master key:
	1. Alias - Your applcation can refer to the alias when using the CMK.
	2. Creation Date - The date and time when the CMK was created
	3. Description - You can add your own description to describe the CMK.
	4. Kay State - Enable, Disabled , pending, deletion, unavailable
	5. Kay Material - Customer-provided or AWS-provided
	6. Stays inside KMS - Can never be exported
-------------------
Set up CMK
	1. Create alias and description, Choose key materials option. 
		Alias ==> Description ==> Key Material
	2. Key Administrative Permissions - IAM users and roles that can administrater (but not use) the key through the KMS API.
		Users ==> Roles ==> Admin Permissions
	3. Key Usage Permissions - IAM Users and roles that can use the key to encrypt and decrypt data
		Users ==> Roles ==> Usage Permissions
-------------------
Exam Tips:
	AWS- MAnaged CMK - AWS-provided and AWS-managed CMK. Used on your behalf with the AWS services integrated with KMS
	Customer-Managed CMK - You create, own and manage yourself
	Data Key - Encryption keys that you can use to encrypt data, Including larger amount of data. You can use a CMK to generate, encrypt, decrypt data kays

Understanding KMS API Calls - Commands

	aws kms encrypt --key-id 3cd4b981-5640-4a6e-ade9-0ea1b4a7729b --plaintext fileb://secret.txt --output text --query CiphertextBlob | base64 --decode > encryptedsecret.txt
	aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://encryptedsecret.txt --output text --query Plaintext | base64 --decode > decryptedsecret.txt
	aws kms re-encrypt --destination-key-id 3cd4b981-5640-4a6e-ade9-0ea1b4a7729b --ciphertext-blob fileb://encryptedsecret.txt | base64 > newencryption.txt 
	aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id 3cd4b981-5640-4a6e-ade9-0ea1b4a7729b
	aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id 3cd4b981-5640-4a6e-ade9-0ea1b4a7729b
	aws kms generate-data-key --key-id 3cd4b981-5640-4a6e-ade9-0ea1b4a7729b --key-spec AES_256

---------------------
Exam Tips
	aws kms encrypt - Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customermaster key.
	aws kms decrypt - Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK)
	aws kms re-encrypt - Decrypts ciphertext and then re-encrypt it entirely within AWS KMS (e.g. when you changethe CMK or manually rotate thr CMK)
	aws kms enable-key-rotation - Enables automatic key rotation every 365 days.
	aws kms generate-data-key - Uses the CMK to generate a data key to encrypt data > 4KB
=====================
Exploring Envelope Encryption
	A process for encryptiong your data. It applies to files > 4KB

	AWS KMS [CMK] -> GenerateDataKey API -> generate Data Key(Envelope Key) -> encrypts Data

	Data key placed next to the data encrypted by CMK

	CMK used for decrypt DataKey 
	DataKey used for decrypt data
---------------------
Why Envelope Encryption? Why not encrypt the data using the CMK derectly?
	Network - When you encrypt data directly with KMS it must be transferred over the network.
	Performance - With envelope encryption, only the data key goes over the network, not your data.\
	Benefits - The data key is used locally in your application or AWS service, avoiding the need to transfer large amounts of data to KMS
---------------------
Envelope Encryption
	Encrypting the key that encrypts our data
	The CMK is used to encrypt the data key (evelope key)
	The data key encrypts our data
	used for encrypting over 4KB
	Using envelope encryption avoids sending all your data into KMS over the network
	Remember the GenerateDataKey API call.
======================
Enabling and Disabling KMS Key Rotation - Demo
	Create a Customer MAster Key (CMK)  - Accept All the default
	After the Key Created - Click the Key rotation tab, select the option for automatic key rotation every year, and click Save
	TO Disable Key Rortation - Deselect the option, and click Save
--------------------------
Auto encryption is available for CMKs
KMS will rotate the cryptographic material on a yearly basis.
it saves previous versions of the cryptographic material so that you can still decrypt the files that were previously encrypted
===========================
Certificate Management in AWS
	What is AWS Certificate Management (ACM)?
	What Are SSL/TLS Certificates?
	ACM and CloudFront
	Exam Tips
--------------------
What is AWS ACM
	Create and manage public and private Secure Sockets Layer(SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates.
	Can be used with AWS services like Elastic LB, CF, API GW and web applications
---------------------
What are SSL/TLS Certificates?
	Digital certificates are used to verify the authenticity of a website
	Enable a secure connection between visitors and the website

	Used during the encryption process to encrypt data in transit
	Provides a secure experience for customers.
	Think of an online banking website or an e-comerce website.
------------------------
Use case 
	A company's website hosted on EC2 instances and served by cloudFront that needs to host content securely 
		and protect user data using SSL/TLS encryption
	In the CF settings, you can optionally associate a custom SSL certificate using ACM.
	The certificate can only be in the 'us-east-1' Region
-----------------------
Exam Tips
	AWS Certificate Manager - Create and manage SSL/TLS certificates for 'securing' your website
	Secure Connections - Enables secure connections to your website using HTTPS
	CF -  When using ACM with CF, the certificate must be created in the us-east-1 Region.
