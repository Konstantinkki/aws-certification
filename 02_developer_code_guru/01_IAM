IAM Access Keys - Exam Tips
	AccessKeys - New Users are assigned an access key ID and secret access key when their accounts are created
	Not For Console Access - These are not the same as a password and you cannot use the access key ID or secret access key to log in to the AWS UI Console
	Programmic Access - You can use access keys to access AWS via APIs and command line

---------------------------------
Viewing Access Keys - You only get to view the access key ID and secret access key once, If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. 
			Make sure to save them in a secure location
Use MFA - Always set up Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA) on your root account
Password Rotation - You can create and customize your own password rotation policies.
